I'll push this once it's ready for mainnet. This is some cool stuff with Graviton and how we can solve the liquidity issue for RWAs, evolving the N-stablecoins aspect to N-RWAs with different pricing changes. Paradigm suggested adding more axes, so I thought about how we can change things so pricing doesn't affect the whole liquidity. We're essentially warping the axes so the assets or liquidity don't snap, right? Using a spacetime example, we called it Graviton because it fundamentally moves all the axes—so yeah.
Dan was also pretty hyped about this. The next goal is to add all this math to the consensus and make the validator—or the consensus—the AMM itself. What I've done for now that kinda works is taking the SVM and running it on Avalanche Go. The issue was how to get it to behave like an EVM. The answer is you don't—SVM is the engine; you add a light EVM converter to it and run off that. We're hitting 20k TPS in prod, but it definitely needs some work.
